* SRFI Metadata
This repository contains a collection of parseable [[https://srfi.schemers.org][SRFI]] metadata.
Currently doesn't generate data about third-party SRFI libraries.
Contributions welcome!

You can view the table [[http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/schemedoc/srfi-metadata/blob/master/table.html][here]].

** How to update the table
   Run =srfi-data.sh= to refresh the SRFI data in =srfi-data.scm=.

   Run =listings.sh= to generate scripts in =listings/\*.sh=.
   This script calls Gauche by default, but you can adjust it to use
   any R7RS Scheme for =listings.scm=.

   Switch to =listings= directory and run
   =for f in \*sh; do echo "$f"; ./"$f"; done= to obtain each
   implementation's supported SRFIs in in =listings/\*.scm=.

   Run =table.sh= (uses Racket) to generate =table.html=. Done!
   You can now push the newest =table.html=.
