* SRFI Metadata
This repository contains a collection of parseable [[https://srfi.schemers.org][SRFI]] metadata.
Currently doesn't generate data about third-party SRFI libraries.
Contributions welcome!

You can view the table [[http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/schemedoc/srfi-metadata/blob/master/table.html][here]].

** How to update the table
   Run =srfi-data.sh= to refresh the SRFI data in =data/srfi-data.scm=.

   Run =listings.sh= to generate scripts in =listings/\*.sh= and run
   them to obtain each implementation's list of supported SRFIs.
   This script calls Gauche by default, but you can adjust it to use
   any R7RS Scheme for =listings.scm=.

   Run =external.sh= (requires Racket with =sxml= and =json= packages)
   to obtain SRFI support data for implementations' external libraries.

   Run =table.sh= (uses Racket) to generate =table.html=. Done!
   You can now push the newest =table.html=.
