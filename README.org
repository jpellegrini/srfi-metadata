* SRFI Metadata
This repository contains a collection of parseable [[https://srfi.schemers.org][SRFI]] metadata.
Contributions welcome!

You can view the table [[http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/schemedoc/srfi-metadata/blob/master/table.html][here]].

** How to update the table
   Simply run =generate.sh=, which takes the following steps:

   Run =srfi-data.sh= to refresh =data/srfi-data.scm=.

   Run =listings.sh= to generate scripts in =listings/*.sh= and run
   each of them to obtain each implementation's list of supported
   SRFIs. (This script calls Gauche by default, but you can adjust it
   to use any R7RS Scheme for =listings.scm=.)

   Run =external.sh= (requires Racket with =sxml= and =json= packages)
   to obtain SRFI support data for implementations' external libraries.

   Run =table.sh= (also uses Racket) to generate =table.html= and open
   it, and done! You can now view the newest =table.html= and push it.
